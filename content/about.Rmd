---

I am a research assistant at the Department of [Statistics], Marmara University and [NordSTAR](https://www.oslomet.no/en/nordstar), Oslo Metropolitan University. In 2020, I obtained my PhD degree from Yıldız Technical University’s Department of Statistics, under the direction of [Erol Eğrioğlu] and [Atif Evren], and I received my master and bachelor degrees from Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, Department of Statistics, under the direction of Erol Eğrioğlu and [Barış Aşıkgil].

In 2018, I won the second prize of Young Scientists Awards by presenting a part of my dissertation at [International Conference on Trends and Perspectives in Linear Statistical Inference (LinStat)] in Poland. 

I am a member of [RLadies], a volunteer for [Yeterly], [LÖSEV] and [Fjord CleanUP]. Also, I like baking,  especially bread! 👩🏻‍🍳   and to do yoga thanks to [Müge Değirmenci! (Yoga Pan) ] 💛
